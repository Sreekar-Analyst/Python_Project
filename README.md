# Health Care Analysis - Python Project 🏥

## Project Description
A Python project to analyze patient health data and predict cardiac risk using machine learning and visualization.
 
## 📂 Files in Repository
- Patient_Dataset.py` - Main Python Script
- patient_dataset.csv` - Raw Dataset
- patient_dataset_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned and processed data

## Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly

## 📊 Features
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Handling missing values
* 15+ different visualizations (graphs and charts)
* Cardiac risk score calculation
* Health insights generation
* Data Analysis and reporting

## 📈 Key Insights from Analysis
1. Age is the strongest factor affecting cardiac risk
2. High cholesterol and blood pressure significantly increase risk
3. Lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise) contribute to cumulative risk
4. BMI and metabolic factors are important indicators
5. Blood Pressure shows clear correlation

## Conclusion
This comprehensive health analytics project successfully identifies high-risk cardiac patients through multi-factor data analysis, enabling proactive healthcare interventions and data-driven medical decisions.
